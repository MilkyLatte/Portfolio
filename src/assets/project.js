        Roqqett is a FinTech app that takes advantage of open banking. In the
        front-end of the app I have developed multiple complex components using
        Javascript and React Native to bring the best experience to the user.
        Some of these components are:
        <ul>
          <li>A secure custom pin pad to enter passwords</li>
          <li>
            A fully custom photo cropping tool to handle the user's profile
            picture
          </li>
          <li>In app data management and caching to increase performance</li>
        </ul>
        The tech stack we have used for the back-end involved NodeJS, MySQL as
        well as OpenAPI validation in addition to third party services used for
        security and payments.
